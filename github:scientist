github/scientist

branch by abstraction

tests are not enough
	- cumbersome and slows down development
	- software has bugs --- therefore your data will have bugs

Data quality
	- bugs may occur because you don't  expect data to behave in 'that' way

production data is the only true data you should test against

branch by abstraction + dark shipping


caveat - not meant to be sused for any code that has side-effects
 -modififies data ( don't use)
 -don't use in production because of performance
 should use for boolean methods

 can configure results to display certain items

 scientist has become a popular pattern at github

 has been ported to other languages
